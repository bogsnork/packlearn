<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of packlearn is for me to learn how to build packages in R.  I doubt anyone else will be interested in this. It does a few trivial and pointless things.  

## Installation

Don't bother looking for this package on CRAN!  If you're really keen use this: 

``` r
devtools::install_github("bogsnork/packlearn")
```

## Example

Here's a cool function to praise any food you like:

``` r
library(packlearn)
## praise food
grreat("Kohlrabi")
```
